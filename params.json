{"name":"phpPGN","tagline":"Set of PHP code to deal with PGN (Portable Game Notation) files...","body":"A PHP written Library to deal with PGN (Portable Game Notation) files. It is currently designed to understand PGN files only for reading purposes, there is no intention yet to validate the files, it assumes the PGN file is correct (e.g., generated from other tools like [ChassPad](http://www.wmlsoftware.com/chesspad.html)).\r\nphpPGN is part of J'adoube-Initiative. By following J'adoube Initiative's philosophy, this project aims to aggregate several functionalities and documentations related to PGN manipulation in one place. In addition to the following information, check out PGN Standard and Related Projects in our [Wiki Page](https://github.com/Jadoube-Initiative/phpPGN/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nBrowse phpPGN [Standard Documentation](https://github.com/Jadoube-Initiative/phpPGN).\r\n\r\n### Importing phpPGN\r\nIn order to use phpPGN in your project, proceed with one of the following steps:\r\n* Place the code into your project by git-pulling it; or\r\n* Download the PHAR (not possible yet) file and include it into your project (see the available [samples](https://github.com/Jadoube-Initiative/phpPGN/tree/master/samples)).\r\n\r\n### Building phpPGN.phar\r\nBecause the project is still in an alpha stage, a PHAR file is not available. However, it's still possible to create it. In order to do that, the ini `phar.readonly` directive must be set to **Off**; so, use `php --ini` to check\r\nwhere is your cli's ini file (let's say `/etc/php5/cli/php.ini` for example), and edit it:\r\n```\r\n$ php --ini\r\n$ sudo nano /etc/php5/cli/php.ini\r\n```\r\nFinally, go to phpPGN's build (say `/home/user/projects/phpPGN/build`) directory and run `createPhar.php`:\r\n```\r\n$ cd /home/user/projects/phpPGN/build\r\n$ ./createPhar.php\r\n```\r\n### Testing (Example: via command line)\r\nIn order to check if all configurations succeeded you may want to run the unit tests by executing the following command in the project directory (e.g.: `/home/user/projects/phpPGN`):\r\n```\r\n$ cd /home/user/projects/phpPGN\r\n$ phpunit test --bootstrap=\"bootstrap.php\"\r\n\r\n...big output ending with something like:\r\n....                      X / X (100%)\r\n\r\nTime: Y ms, Memory: W Mb\r\n\r\nOK (X tests, Z assertions)\r\n```\r\n### Getting help\r\nphpPGN is part of J'adoube Initiative.
