{Radjabov,T: '5th round of the Shamkir Chess 2014, Vugar Gashimov's memorial.
We were in different tournament situations, I was on 50 percent, Magnus was at
+1 after he lost to Caruana before this game with Black. Certainly an
interesting fight was ahead! It's always interesting to play against the World
Champion and I have enjoyed this fight.'} 1. d4 {Radjabov,T} 1... Nf6 2. c4 g6
3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 {Radjabov,T: 'King's Indian Defence. No comments.'} 5. Nge2
O-O 6. Ng3 {Radjabov,T: 'There are so many moves and plans in the opening phase,
but annotating the game and working on chess ECO is quite different. I will not
get far in theoretical debris but will show few most recent examples here:'}

8. Be2 Na6 9. h4 {Radjabov,T: 'It's not as agressive as it looks, only if Black
allows h5 it becomes a kind of tactical and offensive approach, in general it's
more a positional move to play Bg5 after h5 and get Qd2-0-0-0 faster.'} 9... h5

Gelfand won this game. Lutz never castled and tried a Nf1-d2 plan, which is
going nowhere as after Nc4 Black may just go back to c7 threatening .. .b5 later
on. The Computer suggests to change directions here and go for 0-0 h6-Qd2 and
playing on the queenside. Claims White is better but it's far from obvious for a
